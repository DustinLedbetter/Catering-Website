Catering-Website
This project which I am still working on is a catering website for my wife to use to advertise and sell the bakery goods she makes. 
<br>
I chose to code it using the new W3CSS language. It has proven to be a good choice and has been very fun to work with. My next step will be hosting it and adding features using other languages as well.
